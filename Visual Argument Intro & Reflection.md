Intro & Reflection

My visual argument addresses the unrealistic beauty standards and pressures that society puts on women. These unrealistic expectations are perpetuated through media, advertising, and societal norms and are a constant source of noise. These expectations can cause negative effects on mental-health, self-esteem and identity. In my visual argument I want to relay the emotions and hurt women feel trying to conform themselves and the things they will do.

The background of the image is a mannequin, this represents the unrealistic ideals for women. Mannequins are supposed to reflect a body, but the measurements and look of a mannequin are very unrealistic. There is a measuring tape wrapped around the image. Those obsessed with body image get focused on body measurements and numbers. The measuring tape crossing over the body, centering on the neck, represents how suffocating it can be worrying about fitting into these standards. I then found an old news headline that said “The New Beauty-Culture” and while trying to find the best place for it on the image I found that culture can become cult, so I crossed out the rest of the word. Calling it a cult is apt because people will give anything to fit these standards and it can take over one's life.
