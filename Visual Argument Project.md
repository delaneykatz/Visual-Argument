My visual argument addresses the unrealistic beauty standards and pressures that society puts on women. These unrealistic expectations are perpetuated through media, advertising, and societal norms and are a constant source of noise. These expectations can cause negative effects on mental-health, self-esteem and identity. In my visual argument I want to relay the emotions and hurt women feel trying to conform themselves and the things they will do.
